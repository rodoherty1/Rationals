Rationals
=========

This project is a simply demo of some SBT, ScalaTest and rudimentary Scala code (Rationals.scala).

##Some SBT commands
```
$ ~test
$ test
$ test-only -- -n {tag}   " where {tag} is a string that you have marked as a tag in one of your BDD tests.  Examples are quantum or rational
```
